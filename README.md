# 2024GEM-shared-task
In an effort to increase transparency around closed LLM training data outputs in our data-to-text task, we provide ChatGPT outputs for English, Spanish, and Chinese. Files found here are for factual, counterfactual, and fictional categories.

The English folder contains our filtered and unfiltered synthesized English training data (sample size: 1,500 for unfiltered and 1,315 for filtered). We also include annotater (author) judgments (sample size: 99) and ChatGPT judgments of the same sample.

The Chinese folder contains our filtered and unfiltered synthesized Chinese training data (sample size: 1,500 for unfiltered and 463 for filtered).

The Spanish folder contains our filtred and unfiltered synthesized Spanish training data (sample size: 8,643 for unfiltered and 2,735 for filtered). We also include annotater (author) judgments (sample size: 99) and ChatGPT judgments of the same sample.
